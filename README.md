This code defines a simple Shopify app written in Go, with a `/` handler that prints a welcome message and an `/auth/callback` handler that fetches a list of products for the authenticated store and prints their titles. It uses the shopify-go library to interact with the Shopify API, and the `godotenv` library to read the access_token from a `.env` file if it is not set in the environment.

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to create a minimal Docker image for the app. It first builds the app using the `golang:1.15-alpine image`, copies the `.env` file into the build directory, and builds the app binary. It then creates a minimal scratch image and copies the app binary and `.env` file into it. The **SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN** environment variable is set to the value of the **SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN** variable in the `.env` file.

To build and run the Docker image, you can use the following commands:

```
# Build the Docker image
$ docker build -t my-shopify-app .

# Run the Docker image
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 my-shopify-app
```
